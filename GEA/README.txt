This folder contains the information and files required to reproduce the genotype-environment association tests
used in the manuscript. The code titled "pp_012_to_lfmm.R" must be run prior to attempting to run
the other provided codes. This code creates input files needed for GEAs. Much of the GEA code in this
folder was adapted from code provided by Dr. Keaka Farleigh - https://kfarleigh.github.io/
